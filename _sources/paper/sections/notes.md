## Mainen 2016: A better way to crack the brain 
* https://doi.org/10.1038/539159a
* *propose an alternative strategy: grass-roots collaborations involving researchers who may be distributed around the globe, but who are already working on the same problems. Such self-motivated
groups could start small and expand gradually over time. But they would essentially be built from the ground up, with those involved encouraged to follow their own shared interests rather than responding to the strictures of funding sources or external directives.*
* *In short, a generation ago, neuroscientists were largely limited by theory and tools. Today, the bigger problem is effectively harnessing, as a community, what is already available.* 

## IBL 2017: An International Laboratory for Systems and Computational Neuroscience 
* https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.013 
* Aim: *to develop a standardized mouse decision-making behaviour, to make coordinated measurements of neural activity across the mouse brain, and to use theory and analyses to uncover the neural computations that support decision-making.* 
* *Understanding the Brain Demands a Collaborative Approach*. 
* *Overall, there is a disparity in scale between the brain’s complexity and the efforts of individual neuroscience laboratories.*
* Allow postdocs to lead hypothesis-driven projects (e.g. on the role of a single brain region), while benefitting from shared resources. 
* Will make data *accessible once the results are published* - why wait? 

## Wool 2020: Knowledge across networks: how to build a global neuroscience collaboration 
* https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2020.10.020 
* *the IBL’s approach is to implement a distributed research architecture across a
global network of laboratories to assay how decisionmaking behavior is encoded in the mouse brain.*
* *The result is a low-hierarchy organization of scientists that remain independent in skills, research interests, and physical location, who contribute individual expertise toward a shared methodology and develop a common vocabulary in order to communicate across large-scale projects* 
* *it is promising to consider the new types of researchers we can attract if we don’t need to bring them into a single lab, but rather can bring the lab directly to them.*
