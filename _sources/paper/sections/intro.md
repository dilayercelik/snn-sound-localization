* Inspired by the success of endeavours like the Human Genome Project (ref) and CERN (ref), neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations. 
* Though, how to best structure these projects remains an open-question (ref Zach).  
* The largest efforts, e.g. International Brain Laboratory (ref), The Blue Brain Project (ref) and Human Brain Project (ref) bring together tens to hundreds of researchers across multiple laboratories.  
* However, while these projects represent a step-change in scale, they retain a legacy structure which resembles a consortia grant. 
* I.e. there are participating laboratories who collaborate together and then make their data, methods and results available upon publication.
* As such, interested participants face a high barrier to entry: joining a participating laboratory, initiating a collaboration with the project, or awaiting publications. 
* So how could these projects be structured differently?   

* One alternative are bench marking contests, in which participants compete to obtain the best score on a specific task. 
* Such contests have driven progress in fields from machine learning (ref ImageNet) to protein folding (ref CASP), and have begun to enter neuroscience.           
* For example, in Brain-Score (refs) participants submit models, capable of completing a visual processing task, which are then ranked according to a quantitative metric.       
* As participants can compete both remotely and independently, these contests offer a significantly lower barrier to entry.
* Though, they emphasise competition over collaboration, and critically they require a well defined, quantifiable end-point.  
* In Brain-Score, this end-point is a composite metric which describes the model's similarity to experimental data in terms of both behaviour and unit activity (refs).
* However, defining such endpoints for neuroscientific questions remains challenging.    

* Another alternative are massively collaborative projects in which participants work together to solve a common goal.  
* For example, in the Polymath Project (refs) unsolved mathematical problems are posed, and then participants share comments, ideas and equations online as they collectively work towards solutions.         
* Inspired by this approach, we founded COMOB (Collaborative Modelling of the Brain) - an open-source movement, which aims to tackle neuroscientific questions.
* Here, we share our experiences and results from our first project, in which we explored spiking neural network models of sound localization.
